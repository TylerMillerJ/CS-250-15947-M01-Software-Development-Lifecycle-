How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?
Interpreting user needs requires active listening, continuous feedback, and translating those needs into clear, actionable development goals. Creating user stories helps by breaking down complex requirements into simple, understandable pieces from the user's perspective. This keeps the focus on delivering real value and ensures the final product aligns with user expectations.

How do I approach developing programs? What Agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
I approach developing programs using short development cycles (sprints) to build, test, and improve continuously. In the future, I hope to incorporate Agile processes like sprint planning, daily stand-ups, and sprint retrospectives. These practices promote better communication, adaptability to changing requirements, and faster delivery of useful features.

What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
Being a good team member means communicating openly, supporting others, staying accountable, and contributing to the team's goals rather than only focusing on individual tasks. In an Agile environment, it also means being flexible, welcoming feedback, and collaborating closely to solve problems and deliver high-quality software.
